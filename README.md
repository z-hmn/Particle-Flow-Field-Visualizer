# Particle-Flow-Field-Visualizer

An interactive visualization of a Perlin noise-based flow field using p5.js. Watch colorful particles dance across the canvas following smooth, organic patterns generated by Perlin noise.


## Features

- **Real-time particle system** with customizable parameters
- **Interactive controls** for adjusting visualization behavior
- **Sleek dark mode interface** with minimal design
- **Responsive layout** that works on desktop and mobile
- **Smooth animations** with fade trails

## Controls

- **Particles (50-2000)**: Adjust the number of particles in the system
- **Noise Scale (0.0005-0.01)**: Control the smoothness and scale of the flow field
- **Speed (0.5-5.0)**: Change how fast particles move through the field
- **Reset Button**: Clear the canvas and regenerate particles

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in a web browser. No build process or dependencies required!

## How It Works

The visualization uses Perlin noise to create a smooth, continuous flow field. Each particle:

1. Samples the noise field at its current position
2. Converts the noise value to an angle (0-8π)
3. Moves in that direction at the specified speed
4. Leaves a colored trail as it moves
5. Respawns at a random position if it leaves the canvas

The background slowly fades over time, creating elegant trailing effects.

## Technology

- **p5.js** - Creative coding library for canvas rendering
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks, just clean ES6+
- **Pure CSS** - Custom styled controls with no dependencies
